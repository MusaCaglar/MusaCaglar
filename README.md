- 👋 Hi, I’m @MusaCaglar. Welcome to my GitHub page.
- 👀 I’m interested in Mathematical Optimization (i.e., Operations Research (OR)) and Machine Learning (ML).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning state of the art methods at the intersection of OR and ML.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on application of OR and ML at scale and high impact.
- 📫 How to reach me musacaglar@gmail.com

I am a Professor of Practice in Business Analytics and Management Science at the A. B. Freeman School, Tulane University. I have been serving on the faculty since January 2018. I teach business analytics, modeling & analytics, SQL & business intelligence and web analytics courses at the A.B. Freeman School of Business.

Conducting research and contributing to the literature of operations research and analytics are important to me. My research interests include application of optimization, simulation and machine learning algorithms to the practical analytics problems in public sector organizations, healthcare and finance. My research has been published in academic journals such as Annals of Operations Research (one of the top journals in operations research and analytics according to Google Scholar: https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=eng_operationsresearch , OR Spectrum, Socio-Economic Planning Sciences, Expert Systems with Applications (one of the top journals in AI and Machine Learning according to Google Scholar: https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=eng_artificialintelligence), among others.
